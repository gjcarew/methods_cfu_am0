# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
> I need to learn more of them, but I feel like I have a good understanding of how they work.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
> Simple methods seem pretty straightforward.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
> How do you write a method like .gsub! that changes the variable/string passed to it permanently?
